    "overview": "Reconnaissance of hcmute.edu.vn revealed a web server running Microsoft-IIS/10.0 and ASP.NET. Key security concerns include multiple missing critical HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), information disclosure through server banners, a session cookie lacking the 'Secure' attribute, and a large number of identified subdomains (52) significantly expanding the potential attack surface. WHOIS information retrieval failed, hindering domain ownership verification. DKIM is partially configured for email security.",
