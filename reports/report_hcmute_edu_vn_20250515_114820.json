    "overview": "This report summarizes the security reconnaissance findings for hcmute.edu.vn. The assessment identified several security concerns, primarily related to missing HTTP security headers, incomplete email security configurations (missing SPF and DMARC), and information disclosure from server banners. A large number of subdomains, including some with sensitive naming conventions, were also discovered, significantly expanding the potential attack surface. The web server also reported a future date in its HTTP response headers, indicating a possible clock misconfiguration.",
